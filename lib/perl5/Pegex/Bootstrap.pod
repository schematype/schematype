=head1 NAME

Pegex::Bootstrap - Bootstrapping Compiler for a Pegex Grammar

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegex::Bootstrap;
    my $grammar_text = '... grammar text ...';
    my $pegex_compiler = Pegex::Bootstrap->new();
    my $grammar_tree = $pegex_compiler->compile($grammar_text)->tree;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Pegex language is defined in Pegex. In order to do that, it was necessary
to make a bootstrap compiler that did the same thing. This way we could slowly
build up the grammar, and make sure that the 2 compilers do the same thing.
Parsing the Pegex language itself is not terribly hard, so this module just
does it by hand.

Unless you are working on Pegex itself, you can ignore this module.
