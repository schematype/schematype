Pegex::Grammar::Atoms - Pegex Regex Atoms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegex::Grammar::Atoms;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Atoms are special Pegex rules that represent the small pieces of text that you
can use to build up regular expressions. Usually they are one or two
characters.

It may seem like a waste of time to specify C<COLON> in a regex, instead of a
simple C<:>. There are three reasons this is encouraged. First is that you are
defining a grammar for a new language, and it is worth the time to be clear
and verbose. Second, using an abstraction like this can help with portability
to languages with different regex engines. Finally, it makes the grammar for
Pegex so much simpler, because a C</> is always a part of the Pegex syntax,
and a C<SLASH> is part of your grammar.
